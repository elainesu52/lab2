/*
   This code can be compiled and run ok.

   Create an input file file.in.txt which consists of
   five pairs of numbers and each line consists of two integers,
   representing height (in centimeter) and mass (in kilogram)
   for a family member of John.
   The inputfile ends up with two zeroes.  

   Read in file.in.txt and create a file file.out.txt.
   For each line in file.in.txt, each line in file.out consists of
   the calculated BMI value and its corresponding category.

   In the program, I design a class which records
   height and mass values as private data members.
   To manipulate these data members, I provide
   corresponding get and set functions.
   I also provide a public member function for
   returning the BMI value, and a public member function for
   returning the category (as a string).

   usage (how to run):
     lab1  (then input n)

   input file:
     file.in.txt

   output files:
     file.out.txt

   compile (how to compile):
     g++ -o lab2 main.cpp BMI.h BMI.cpp
